["usr", "I'm having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don't have any."]
["sys", "Oh I see. You feel as though you don't have any friend's currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It's so hard to see people and keep relationships right now\n"]
["usr", "Well it's more that I think I've never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with"]

Blender-Joint：i can understand that - i've had some friends come and go for a while. but i know that you have some people in your life who you can trust.
MISC：it'll be okay, you just have to keep trying.
TransESC：i can understand that. it seems like you are not alone in feeling this way.
Spark-V4.0:It's okay to feel this way. Everyone has moments of loneliness and feeling disconnected. Remember, it's not about the quantity of friends, but the quality of connections you have.
Baichuan:I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay to feel lonely or unsure about friendships. Remember, it's never too late to build connections with others.
qwen-turbo:Have you considered joining clubs or groups that align with your interests? This can be a great way to meet new people and potentially form meaningful connections.
chatglm：You've mentioned that you feel like you haven't had many friends.It's important to have someone you can confide in and share experiences with.
Ground truth：that's a really hard thing to be going through. i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in?

["usr", "I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in-school studies. \n"]
["sys", "Do you feel it is more stressful online?"]
["usr", "I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating\n"]
["usr", "no it's just that it's a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it's because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow. \n"]

Blender-Joint：have you considered having someone else take the time for you?
MISC：i'm sure that's not good, but don't give up!
TransESC：i can understand that. i also have been in a similar situation. i feel like i have to be procrastic and slow in order to get through the day.
Spark-V3.0:I understand how you feel. It's normal to feel overwhelmed with so much work and the pandemic can make it harder to focus. Remember to take breaks and prioritize self-care.
Baichuan2-Turbo:It's okay to feel overwhelmed; focus on what you can control now. Remember to take breaks, and try to create a schedule to manage your tasks effectively.
qwen-turbo:Remember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize self-care. Try breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps and set achievable goals for yourself.
chatglm：That makes sense. online classes can be beneficial but it's also important to stay organized and prioritize tasks to avoid procrastination. 
Ground truth：maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after.

MISC：well, it's okay to be lazy, it is not that bad, especially with the pandemic going on.
TransESC：i can relate to that. i've been in a lot of pajamas all day.
Spark-V3.0:It's okay to feel lazy sometimes.
Baichuan2-Turbo:I understand feeling unmotivated. It's okay to take time for yourself.
qwen-turbo:Maybe try doing something creative or exploring a new hobby to help reignite your motivation.
chatglm：It's okay to feel lazy sometimes. Take things one step at a time. Why don't we walk outside and enjoy the fresh air? It might help clear your mind.
Ground truth：Well you're resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone?"

Blender-Joint：i love non fiction too! i love the fantasy genre.
MISC：i really enjoy mystery and drama books.
TransESC：i love historical nonfi as well. i also enjoy reading non fiction as well!

qwen-turbo:Reading can also be a great way to escape into different worlds and take your mind off of your current stressors.
chatglm：I enjoy reading dystopian fantasy style books and historical nonfiction. They take me on exciting adventures and help me learn about different cultures and time periods.

["usr", "Haha I would hope so\n"]
["usr", "Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus\n"]
["usr", "What do you think I should do then?\n"]

Blender-Joint：i used to feel the same way, but i found that the only way to avoid them was to ignore them. i suggest talking to them about the matter and tell them that you are worried that
MISC：i see. i think you have to find a way to make peace with them.
TransESC：i think that would be a good place to start!
Spark-V3.0:It's understandable that their comments are hurtful. Maybe try to ignore them and focus on positive interactions with other people.
Baichuan2-Turbo:It's okay to take a break from them. You can try sitting in a different spot or focus on positive people.
qwen-turbo:Have you considered talking to a trusted adult or counselor about how you're feeling?
chatglm：I think you should try to ignore them and not give them any attention. It's not worth getting upset over someone else's mean behavior.
Ground truth：i understand, school was tough for me too.

qwen-turbo:Is there anything you're doing to cope with the situation or manage your anxiety around it?
