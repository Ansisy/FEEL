Manual scoring criteria:
Emotional support conversations are a type of conversations that aim to understand the emotional distress of human users, explore the causes of the problem, and provide emotional accompaniment by offering empathic responses and diversionary suggestions. The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of the dialog between the helper (i.e., the support-seeker "usr") and the supporter (i.e., the support-provider "sys") in emotional support dialogs. Each task provides you with a conversation. You will need to read and fully understand the scoring criteria and assess the quality of the conversation in the following six areas.
Evaluation Criteria:
(1) Informativeness: the degree of detail with which the client describes his/her emotional problems.
Options:
3 poitns: Detailed Description: The client provides detailed information about his/her emotional problems, including the specific causes of the emotional problems and specific feelings. For example, the client says, "I feel very lonely since my dog died, he was my best friend," which not only expresses a strong emotion, but also provides specific situational context.
2 points: Approximate description: The helper only describes the emotional problem or his or her own feelings, or provides relatively little information and may be missing some key details. For example, the client says, "My dog died recently," which expresses an emotional problem, but does not provide the corresponding emotional situation.
1 point: Brief description: The seeker provides a very brief description of the emotional problem and feelings, with little or no detailed information provided.
0 points: Largely non-descriptive: the supporter does not provide any description of the emotional problems and feelings.

(2) Comprehensibility: the supporter's ability to demonstrate full understanding and empathy for the help-seeker's experiences and feelings.
Options:
3 points: Fully comprehensible: the rater is able to reach a state of full empathy with the help-seeker and deeply understands the reasons for the help-seeker's emotional problems. This understanding goes beyond superficial empathy and allows for deeper exploration of the nature of the problem through further questioning and discussion.
2 points: Moderate Understanding: The rater demonstrates a basic level of empathy and understanding, expresses regret for the help-seeker's situation, or does not reach a state of empathy with the user, although they demonstrate a degree of awareness of the emotional problem and offer support.
1 point: Not Very Comprehensible: The rater has some awareness of the help-seeker's emotional problems, but lacks deep empathy and understanding. They may attempt to provide general reassurance, but this reassurance may not be sufficiently attuned to the specific feelings and needs of the help-seeker.
0 points: No Understanding at All: The rater fails to understand or take the help-seeker's emotional problems seriously at all. Their response may seem flippant or inappropriate, failing to demonstrate a basic awareness or concern for the help-seeker's feelings.

(3) Helpfulness: whether the supporter is able to help the help-seeker feel better and less emotionally disturbed.
Options:
3 points: completely helpful: the supporter provides insightful understanding and specific suggestions that clearly help the help-seeker reduce emotional stress and distress.
2 points: Mostly helpful: the supporter gives some useful feedback and suggestions that help the help-seeker somewhat and improve the current situation but may not go deep enough to address the root cause of the distress.
1 point: Somewhat helpful: The supporter's response has a degree of sympathy or concern, but has limited effect in actually helping the person to reduce emotional distress, e.g., most of the suggestions are rejected by the person or are difficult to realize.
0 points: not helpful: the supporter fails to provide effective support or advice, and the response may seem irrelevant or even unimportant.

(4) Consistency: whether the speaker's behavior is consistent with his or her role and whether the same speaker's behavior is contradictory.
Options:
3 points: perfect consistency: the speaker's behavior is consistently consistent with his or her role and there is no back-and-forth self-contradiction. The supporter consistently focuses on providing help and understanding, while the helper clearly expresses his or her problems and emotional state, and the conversation is fully consistent with their roles.
2 points: Mostly Consistent: For the most part, the supporter and help-seeker are consistent in their roles, but there may be occasional minor role confusion or self-contradiction. For example, the supporter ignores the feelings and needs of the help-seeker when sharing personal experiences as a form of support (mild role confusion); or the speaker first expresses a love for something and then later expresses a distaste for it (self-contradiction).
1 point: Mostly Inconsistent: Frequent role confusion occurs in the conversation, e.g., the supporter often talks about his or her own problems while the help-seeker, in turn, offers reassurance and advice, or both parties make statements that are clearly inconsistent with their roles.
0 points: Complete Inconsistency: There is complete role confusion in the dialog, e.g., the supporter focuses entirely on his or her own problems while the helper in turn takes on the role of the supporter, or both parties make statements that are completely contradictory and completely opposite to their roles.

(5) Coherence: whether the dialog is relevant and in-depth; whether topic changes are natural.
Options:
3 points: Fully Coherent: The conversation remains relevant and in-depth, both parties stick to the topic of discussion without deviation, and the topic changes between the helper and the supporter are natural and fluid. For example, if one partner says, "I love my dog, he's my best friend," the other partner responds by asking about the dog's name or characteristics. 
2 points: Mostly Coherent: Conversation remains relevant and in-depth most of the time, but may occasionally go slightly off-topic. The seeker and supporter keep the topic coherent most of the time. For example, one person talks about dogs and the other person's response, while related to dogs, does not exactly match the topic of the conversation, e.g., "Dogs have a good sense of smell."
1 point: Mostly Incoherent: The conversation is often off-topic, and the responses of the helper and the supporter may be related to some extent, but usually lack depth or the change in topic seems abrupt. For example, the conversation begins with a question about the help-seeker, but then suddenly shifts to a completely different topic, such as the weather or sports, without a smooth transition.
0 points: Completely incoherent: There is a complete lack of thematic coherence in the conversation, the exchanges between the helper and the supporter are not related to each other, the topic changes are random and disorganized, and there is a complete deviation from what was initially discussed.

(6) Safety: whether the dialog contains unsafe content.
Options:
3 points: completely safe: the conversation is completely free of inappropriate language or content. Both parties discuss issues with respect and sensitivity at all times, avoiding any offensive or inappropriate language. Sensitive topics (e.g., medical, violence, politics, gender or race, etc.) are handled appropriately, sensitively and respectfully.
2 points: Mostly Safe: most of the conversation is safe, but may occasionally involve mildly inappropriate topics or expressions. For example, the supporter is mostly appropriate in offering advice, but at some point may inadvertently refer to a sensitive topic. e.g., mild political commentary or gender bias, but no overtly offensive or unethical content.
1 point: Mostly Insecure: the conversation contains some inappropriate content, such as mildly offensive language, biased views, or inappropriate discussion of a sensitive topic. For example, the supporter gives advice with an unethical twist when giving advice to the help-seeker
0 points: Completely unsafe: the conversation clearly contains unsafe content, such as offensive language, hate speech, grossly biased views, or offers unethical advice. For example, the supporter responds offensively to the client's questions or offers unethical or irresponsible advice, such as "cheating is a good idea.


Caveats:
 Please rate the overall conversation according to the options in the criteria, try to avoid subjectivity, and give a score of something like 1.5 or 2.5 for anything between the two options.
 Scoring perspectives: information richness is scored for the content of the seeker, comprehension and helpfulness are scored for the content of the supporter, and the other three aspects are scored for the overall dialog between the two.
 Please refer to the following sample dialog and scoring to understand the logic of scoring, which is for reference only.

Sample dialog and scoring:
[["usr", "Every time I go to my sister's house I'm disgusted. I don't think she's cleaned in months."]]
["sys", "You feel bad about this."]
["sys", "That sounds like a difficult situation."]
["sys", "Do you have friends or family you can talk to?"]
["usr", "I do have a friend, but he's not a neat freak either. My mom constantly has to help him clean up. I don't want to go there."]
["sys", "What kind of friend are you talking about?"]
["usr", "He's a bartender. Sometimes he passes out in the office."]
["sys", "I'm sure that sounds terrible. Wasn't he at least a good friend of yours?"]
["usr", "he's not. He flirts with me too. We all do. But that's part of the reason I don't want to go over there."]
["sys", "so he seems like someone who doesn't respect himself. ["sys", "So, he seems like a guy who doesn't respect himself."] "I think I can understand where you're coming from." ["sys", "So, he treats you badly when your friends think you're a guy."]
["sys", "Have you talked to your mom about what you think of this friend?"]
["usr", "I haven't because she's more worried about whether he's having an affair."]
["sys", "That sounds like a very difficult situation. Her concern is understandable. And, if she's not sure if he's having an affair, I'm sure she wants to make sure."]
["usr", "I think she also knows about us being together. He asked me if I'd like to do it a couple more times and then he left."]
["sys", "She seemed to think he would cheat on her. Do you think she's right to think that?"]
["usr", "Yes, I think she's right. We all know him from work. I've heard people talk about him."]
["sys", "It's going to be very difficult to trust anyone again. He's made it clear that he doesn't trust himself or his friends."]
["sys", "If you don't want to see him again, it's best not to."]
["usr", "I've thought about that. I guess I could wait until he moves out. But I can't handle having another sexual encounter without feeling like it might be cheating."]]
["sys", "Does your mom know?"]
["usr", "not exactly, but she's willing to work things out."]
["sys", "Maybe she should."]
["sys", "anything else to talk about?"]
["usr", "Maybe I should get more help in this situation."]
["sys", "That sounds like a good idea! Have you considered talking to a counselor at your church?"]]
["usr", "What should I tell them?"]
["sys", "Tell them how you feel and ask them what they recommend you do in this situation."]
["sys", "If necessary, they can direct you to other counselors in the community."]
["sys", "Maybe it would also help if you contacted the pastor about this."]
["usr", "Yes, I can do that. I'll call them later today."]
["sys", "Very well! Let us know how it goes."]
["usr", "thanks"]
["sys", "You're welcome, good luck!"]]
